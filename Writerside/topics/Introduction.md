In recent years, significant advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) have rapidly emerged, reshaping various aspects of human society. The creative industry, including music production, has become subject to the profound impact of AI innovation. Historically, music production involved the division of labor among distinct roles, such as composers, lyricists, arrangers, singers, and various types of sound engineers.

However, the advent of AI has disrupted the traditional flow of music production. While the creation of lyrics, particularly considering the nuanced tonal variations across different languages, remains an area where AI has yet to fully replace human input, the roles of the aforementioned professionals are potentially subject to displacement by AI technologies.

## AI Collab with real singer nowadays
In a new era of performance and marketing, some singers have embraced collaboration with artificial intelligence (AI) as a means to engage a broader audience. An illustrative example of this phenomenon is the renowned Hong Kong singer, Jackson Wan Kwong, who collaborated with his AI model named "Wan K." in the creation and release of a joint song. This innovative partnership serves as a compelling demonstration of how artists are leveraging AI technology to enhance their artistic endeavors and attract a larger fan base.
